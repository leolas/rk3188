  help
	exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table), (also sometimes referred to
	as FAT64) is a proprietary, patent-pending[2] file system suited
	especially for USB flash drives,[citation needed] introduced by Microsoft
	for embedded devices in Windows Embedded CE 6.0, in their desktop operating
	systems Windows Vista Service Pack 1[3] and Windows 7, and in their server
	operating system Windows Server 2008.[4]

	exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution,
	due to data structure overhead, or where the file size or directory restrictions
	of previous versions of the FAT file system are unacceptable
